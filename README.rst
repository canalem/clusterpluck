clusterpluck
============
Simple, user-friendly python package to isolate and analyse Gaia DR2 cluster data.

In its current form it can be used to find, download and plot star data in the form of CSV table and CMDs, proper motion scatter plots and distance kernel density graphs. The estimated cluster distance can be extracted based on a simple inversion of the parallax with a small zero point error correction.
