clusterpluck
============
Simple, user-friendly python project to isolate and analyse Gaia DR2 and EDR3 cluster data. I'm creating this as a hands on aid to learn Python as well as develop something that interests me and may be of use at some point.

In its current form it can be used to find, download and plot star data in the form of CSV table and CMDs, proper motion scatter plots and distance kernel density graphs. The estimated cluster distance is extracted based on a simple inversion of the parallax with a zero point error correction.

You can read the beta documentation here_.
